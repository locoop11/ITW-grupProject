                    <p>
                    In the beggining of each game, is shown a board filled with jewels of seven different types randomly arranged, 
                    where three jewels of the same type cannot be aligned horizontally.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A move consists of selecting two adjacent jewels, horizontally or vertically, 
                    which are exchanged (one occupies the other's place and vice versa) if, as a result, 
                    three or more identical jewels are aligned horizontally.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When three or more identical jewels are lined up horizontally (or vertically), they are eliminated from the board
                    and the jewels above those eliminated go down the board to occupy the spaces that became vacant. 
                    At the same time, at the top of the board, new randomly selected gems appear.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A chain reaction can happen if, after removing and repositioning jewels, the board is left with three or more jewels
                    aligned horizontally.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The selection of jewels can be done with the mouse or the keyboard, only one of these input devices is sufficient. 
                    For example, with the mouse it would be enough to click on a jewel to select it. 
                    <br>
                    There may be boards where, due to the arrangement of the jewels, it is impossible to make a move,
                    and the player can manually end the game by pressing the button 'Quit!'.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A game ends when the goal of removing twenty or more gems from the board is reached, 
                    or if the 'Quit!' game button is manually pressed.

                        The game's objective is to line up three or more identical jewels, causing them to be eliminated from a 8x8 board, 
                        occasionally causing a chain reaction in which the adjacent jewels, when occupying the spaces that were left vacant, 
                        generate other alignments and eliminations of jewels.
